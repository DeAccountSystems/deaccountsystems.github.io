# Invitation Rewards

DAS believes that those who drive the popularity of DAS should also be able to share the fruits of DAS growth and development. Therefore, DAS has implemented an invitation rebate mechanism at the contract level.

If someone uses your invitation link when signing up for a DAS account, or fills in your DAS account as the inviter. Then, you will get 10% of their registration fee as an invitation bonus. The reward will be credited in the form of CKB immediately after the registration is completed. The rewards can be viewed in the DAS administration interface.
