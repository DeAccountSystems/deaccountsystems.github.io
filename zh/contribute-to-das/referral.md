# Enthusiasts/Promoters

The .bit team believes that those who promote the adoption of .bit should be able to share in the benefits of its growth. Therefore, .bit has implemented an invite-reward mechanism at the contract level.

If someone registers a .bit account using your invite link or fills in your .bit account as the referrer, you will receive a certain percentage of their registration fee as a referral reward. [View reward details](build-together.md).

The referral reward is settled in a decentralized manner and is paid to the referrer immediately after the invitee completes registration. Due to the underlying principles of Nervos CKB, rewards need to reach a certain amount before being distributed. Also, since .bit is a smart contract running on Nervos CKB, it can only recognize Nervos CKB assets internally. In fact, the cost of actions such as registration/renewal/management/reward settlement within .bit is based on CKB. Therefore, referral rewards are also paid in CKB form, which can be viewed and extracted in the registration service management interface.

## FAQ

### What are referrers/registrars/channels?

**Referrers**: any .bit account can act as a referrer. If you fill in a .bit account as your referrer when registering an account, you can get a certain discount; if someone fills in your .bit account as the referrer when registering, you can also get a certain reward.

**Channels**: any product (such as a wallet) that integrates .bit registration services can be called a channel. If users complete registration through the channel, the channel can get a certain percentage of the registration fee. [Learn about channels](../v/chinese-1/gong-tong-jian-she/channel.md).

**Registrars**: organizations that provide users with registration interfaces and payment methods. [Learn about registrars](../v/chinese-1/gong-tong-jian-she/registrar.md).

### Are referrer/channel rewards settled centrally? Why do they have to reach a certain amount before being distributed?

Referral rewards are settled in a decentralized manner and are paid to the referrer immediately after the invitee completes registration. The reason why they have to reach a certain amount before being distributed is due to the underlying principles of Nervos CKB. It is necessary to reach a certain amount to ensure the decentralized settlement.

### Why is CKB the settlement currency for referrer/channel rewards?

This is because .bit is a smart contract running on Nervos CKB, and it can only recognize Nervos CKB assets internally. In fact, the cost of actions such as registration/renewal/management/reward settlement within .bit is based on CKB. The reason why other currencies can be used to pay registration fees is that the registrar provides corresponding services.
